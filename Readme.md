# Web application example in vanilla javascript

This is an attempt to build a very simple, but working application in plain javascript and node http server. <br/>
## Rules

1. Not a single line of external source frameworks/libraries

1. Anything is allowed as long as it's in a standard and it works on different browsers and is responsive.

1. Server.js for http server code, public folder for html, js, css files
